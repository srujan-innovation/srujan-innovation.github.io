                        <b><u> BUSSINESS RESEARCH : AS A CONCEPT</b></u><br>
                        Business research is a process of acquiring detailed information on all the areas of business and using such information to maximize the sales and profit of the business.

In simple words, it can be stated as the acquisition of information or knowledge for professional or commercial purposes to determine opportunities and goals for a business.<br>
                        Business research can be done for anything and everything. In general, when people speak about business research design, it means asking research questions to know where the money can be spent to increase sales, profits, or market share. Such research is critical to make wise and informed decisions.<br><br>
                        <b><u>WHY RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT FOR ANY KIND OF BUSINESS?</b></u><br>
