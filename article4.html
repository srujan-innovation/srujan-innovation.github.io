                        Srujan ! Creation....Yes we are creating the waves of innovative ideas and IRE School of GIBS adds extra sparkles to our journey, Undoubtedly.
                         We believe that the journey of GIBS - IRE is leading us to become innovative innovator... justified researcher... and extraordinary entrepreneur...of Future.<br><br>

                        From the very first day we started to form our IRE  team which consists of six members from various parts of the country which we feel much more diversified.
                         Right on that day, we started to engage with our team members by creating team name, our logos, the mission of our team ,and we spotted opportunities and came to know about the talents hidden among us.
                          We are diversified by land not by mind !<br><br>

                        As a part of our first trimester we are asked to come with two of our own business ideas as an individual and we created product vision board and business Canvas model for those ideas.
                         Then our first and unique creations by srujan's is our website which you are watching right now. We started uploading or presentations of our ideas,
                          memories of regular meetings from the very first day and designated ourselves as chief executive officer, chief marketing officer, chief finance officer,
                           public relations ect, which is more motivational to do so. Then  we came through the research about the user, finding of the problem and the problem statement what is the need,
                            Persona mapping elevated business Canvas model and customer journey and experience of our business ideas which helps us to learn more about the actual business in the market.<br><br>

                        Here comes our deliverables of second trimester which is more broader and knowledgeable to us in various dimensions.
                         Now our 12 ideas breakdown into  two and then  one ,which is our final business idea . We started to write research paper of that Idea and an outline of business plan is made.
                          We Srujans are creating an product, which is going to be an vegetarian replacement of essential vitamins minerals and protein which are basically incurred in non vegetarian food.
                           Innovative isn't it. We are on the process of creating the first cut off for prototype where we are preparing few recipes. 
                           As an interesting part of trimester two, we are supposed to conduct an interview with entrepreneur where we got lots of knowledgeable insights regarding the idea to ideation of business by the actual business players in the market.
                            All these are documented text and videos .<br><br>

                        With the memory of intellectual and proficient journey of two trimesters we are proudly stepping to our third and final trimester of IRE .<br><br>
