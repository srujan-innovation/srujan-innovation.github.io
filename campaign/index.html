							<p>I have an innovative idea on the fire extinguisher ball. Its like a ball of medium size which can control the fire and helps in reducing the fire if any fire accidents occurs in any places like hospitals and schools or colleges or any other places. The required components for making this , are nitrogen or carbon dioxide to propel a stream of fire-squelching agent to the fire. The active material may be a powder such as potassium bicarbonate , liquid water, an evaporating fluorocarbon or the propelling agent itself. The main reason for creating this innovation is it is so handy and can be used so easily without any effort . The usage of this is fire extinguisher ball is just to throw it in the fire area with a lot of force so that it burst and with that the fire will reduce to an extent.</p>

							<p>One idea which I've got in my mind is that to start an app which connects all restaurants and hotels for the surplus food from these restaurants and also supermarkets and by this we can reduce the food waste and helping and serving those who are hungry and needy for food. This app can use location based technology to and serve the food who are nearby or for any any orphan or old age organization. This could promote sustainability and tackling hunger in the society.</p>

							<p>Passengers often wait at bus stops without knowing when the bus will arrive, leading to long waits and sometimes choosing more expensive transport options. To address this, a mobile app could be developed, connecting to bus conductors' ticket machines via GPS. The app would provide real-time bus locations and available seats based on ticket data, reducing overcrowding at stops and enhancing the commuter experience. Just as we now have apps for tracking train status, a similar solution could greatly benefit public bus commuters, who number in the millions.</p>

							<p>The service which i have in my mind is pest control services. First i need to have an app for that and whoever can need the service can register and I'll be also promoting the local promotions through posters and pamplates. 
								Firstly i need to start locally and then create an app for that so that i can open a big branches all over india . 
								The main reason for this idea is to give a eco-friendly and healthy environment by saying no to all the diseases and infections due to these pests. It will be also helping not only for humans but also for the animals staying around. 
								Now a days many wide variety of disease are spreading around ..so by this pest control society we can eradicate these diseases and pests or germs by making  sanitized india.</p>

							<p>Starting a small-scale business involves minimal capital, fewer employees, and limited machinery. Small businesses typically require investments under 1 crore and have characteristics like single ownership (sole proprietorship), owner-managed, localized operations, labor-dependence over technology, adaptability, and efficient utilization of local resources. Examples include bakeries, local chocolate production, handicrafts, and snack manufacturing.</p>
